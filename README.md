# 📊 Linear Regression

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict placement outcomes using features from the `placement.csv` dataset available on Kaggle.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about student academic performance and placement outcomes.

- **Features** include: academic scores, work experience, specialization, etc.
- **Target variable**: salary or placement status.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (for model training and evaluation)

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load and explore the dataset.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Split into training and test sets

3. **Modeling**  
   - Apply Linear Regression  
   - Evaluate using metrics like R², MAE, MSE

4. **Visualization**  
   - Plot regression line  
   - Visualize residuals and performance
